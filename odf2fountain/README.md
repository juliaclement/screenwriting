## **Usage:**
After installing, this is used from the command line:

`	`python3 odftofountain.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--forcetypes] [--extendedfountain] [--debug] file [files ...]

positional arguments:

`  `file/files	input files space separated

options:

`  `-h, --help	show help message and exit

`  `--output OUTPUT

`		`output filename. Default = input filename.fountain

`  `--forcetypes	Start lines with a special character from the [fountain specification](https://fountain.io/syntax) rather than let the fountain translator use heuristics to determine line type.

`  `--extendedfountain

`		`Enable extra type forcing characters not supported by most fountain translators. Currently just % for Dialogue

`  `--debug, -debug       provide developer information
### **Setup**
1. Install dependencies, see below
1. Download the program folder from github
## **Dependencies**
- The latest version of python3
## **Language**
These documents and programs are in New Zealand English which does not use American spelling. If you don’t like reading correctly spelled New Zealand English, please don’t read them.
## **Manifest:**
odf2fountain.py -- the program

README.md -- this file
## **To do:**
1. Writing some tests is required.
## **Experimental**
None of these tools are intended to do the complete job, but I am prepared to consider requests for small changes that improve usability and accept pull requests for enhancements.

I have no current plans to write installers, or Pip packages.  For the two most popular operating systems I lack the means to test created installers. I would welcome requests from interested and technically capable people who would like to join the project to create installers for some or all platforms on an ongoing basis.
